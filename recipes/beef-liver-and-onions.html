        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef is a very high commodity in Haiti, so when a cow is slaughtered, nothing goes to waste. Organs in particular have a very unique taste and can either taste really good in the right hands or really bad in the wrong. When cooking Beef Liver or (Fwa bef) its all about the temperature. Cooking it too high and you can end up with a piece of leather. Cook it too low and you will end up with what looks like mushy ground beef. The secret is to sauté high and finish low..
